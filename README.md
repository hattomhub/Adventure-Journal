# Adventure Journal

## // The Idea
Developed an app inspired on the song "I'll Make A Man Out Of You" from the film "Mulan".
We decided to make an app where users could post, share and view events, themed around adventures and rate them with the objective of centralize regional events in order to connect people or granting easy access to new experiences.
Our MVP was a website where users could view and post adventures.

## // The Development
We split our team in 2, where each party developed either the Frontend or the Backend of our WebAPP.
The Backend dealt with creating a database and a Rest API using Spring MVC with Hibernate to map our model to the database.
The Frontend handled the received data from the API using Axios and React to present the pages and pop-ups.

## // My Role
I was primarily involved in frontend development and also contributed to peer programming in the early stages of our back end and business logic.

## // Tech & Methodologies
Agile, Scrum, Java, Maven, Spring MVC, JPA, Hibernate, MySQL, REST, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Axios.
